Version 0.1.0 marks the initial release of the complete clean-slate rewrite of Berry-AIGC-Toolbox from the legacy C#/.NET architecture to a modern, high-performance, cross-platform stack powered by Tauri 2, Rust core crates, and Vue 3 + TypeScript.

- Checkpoint Model Catalog & Hash Cache (`ModelManagerModal.vue`) supporting AUTOMATIC1111 `cache.json` import and bidirectional hash resolution.
- File-level operations: moving, copying, safe deletion to system Trash / Recycle Bin (`trash` crate), and reveal in system file manager (Finder / Explorer / Files).
- HTML5 Drag-and-Drop from virtual grid directly onto sidebar Folders, Albums, and Tags.
- Database maintenance dashboard (`DatabaseManagerModal.vue`) with real-time metrics, one-click `VACUUM` compaction, and point-in-time backup export/restore (`VACUUM INTO`).
