# 🏗️ Omera Architecture

## Identity transition

The accepted target is Omera (`com.berryuiki.omera`), repository `BerryUIKI/Omera`, database `omera.db`, and settings prefix `omera_`. Runtime and crate renaming is pending; paths and database names below describe the existing implementation. Follow [OMERA_MIGRATION.md](OMERA_MIGRATION.md) before switching identity. Storage changes follow [STORAGE_EVOLUTION.md](STORAGE_EVOLUTION.md), preserving applied migrations.

**Omera** is a high-performance desktop application built on **Tauri 2**, **Rust**, **Vue 3**, and **SQLite**. It uses a multi-crate Rust backend to handle heavy I/O, file system operations, and metadata extraction, while providing a modern Eagle-style 3-Pane Studio UI in the frontend webview.

## 📦 Multi-Crate Workspace Layout

The Rust backend is structured as a modular Cargo workspace rooted at `/Cargo.toml`:

| Crate Path | Role & Responsibility | Key Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`src-tauri/`** | Thin application shell. Manages window state, frameless window decorations, app lifecycle, and exposes IPC endpoints to the frontend. | `tauri`, `tauri-plugin-dialog`, `trash`, internal crates |
| **`crates/omera-domain/`** | Pure domain models, value objects, metadata formats (`MetadataFormat`), sort criteria, and error types. Zero I/O dependencies. | `serde`, `serde_json` |
| **`crates/omera-metadata/`** | Container sniffers (`detect_container`) and metadata extractors for WebUI (A1111/SD.Next), ComfyUI, NovelAI, Fooocus, InvokeAI, EasyDiffusion, and `.txt` sidecars. | `omera-domain`, `kamadak-exif`, `serde_json` |
| **`crates/omera-scan/`** | Recursive recovery scanner plus path-targeted reconciliation. Uses incremental fingerprinting `(size_bytes, modified_at)`, batches database upserts, and emits progress events. | `omera-domain`, `omera-metadata`, `omera-storage`, `walkdir` |
| **`crates/omera-storage/`** | SQLite persistence layer. Owns schema migrations (`MIGRATIONS`), structured metadata indexing, multi-term query builder, model hash reverse cache, and live database backup/restore. | `omera-domain`, `rusqlite` |

## 🗄️ Database & Schema Management

All user metadata, albums, tags, and cached checkpoint models are persisted in a local SQLite database (`omera.db`) located in the OS standard application data directory.

- **Schema Evolution**: Handled via `PRAGMA user_version` migrations. All schema transitions are strictly incremental, atomic, and defined in `crates/omera-storage/src/migrations.rs`.
- **Concurrency & WAL**: SQLite operates in `WAL` (Write-Ahead Logging) mode, enabling non-blocking reads during background filesystem scanning.
- **Maintenance & Safety**: Supports live runtime `VACUUM` compaction and non-locking snapshot export via `VACUUM INTO`.

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **Vue 3 Composition API** + **TypeScript** + **Vite**:

### 1. Studio Layout Architecture
- **Frameless Window (`TitleBar.vue`)**: Implements custom Windows/macOS/Linux frameless window controls with `@tauri-apps/api/window` and titlebar dragging.
- **Integrated MenuBar (`MenuBar.vue`)**: Desktop dropdown menus (`File`, `Edit`, `View`, `Tools`, `Help`) with clean single-language rendering.
- **Left Navigation (`Sidebar.vue`)**: Collapsible navigation bar managing library views, recursive folder trees, color tags, and smart albums.
- **Center Canvas (`VirtualGrid.vue` & `FileList.vue`)**: Virtualized fixed-width Grid and Waterfall layouts. Viewport resizing changes column count without stretching cards; per-column binary search limits scroll-time visibility work to the active window.
- **Right Property Inspector (`InspectorPane.vue`)**: Tokenized positive/negative prompt chips with one-click copy, model specs table, and collapsible raw JSON viewer.
- **Quick Look Lightbox (`LightboxModal.vue`)**: Immersive fullscreen viewer with pan, zoom, and keyboard navigation.

### 2. State & Localization
- **Reactive i18n (`src/i18n/`)**: Lightweight reactive internationalization supporting 7 locales (`en`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `de`, `fr`, `es`) and automatic OS language detection (`auto`).
- **Updater (`src/utils/updater.ts` & `UpdateModal.vue`)**: SemVer comparison against GitHub Releases API with automated asset matching and release notes rendering.
- **Async Feature Surfaces**: Infrequent modals, drawers, managers, onboarding, and comparison views use dynamic component imports and are mounted only while open, keeping their JavaScript and scoped CSS out of the initial bundle.

### 3. Startup and Thumbnail Scheduling

- The shell loads the indexed SQLite library first so the gallery becomes usable without waiting for filesystem I/O.
- Optional startup scans are rate-limited per folder. New installations leave startup scanning disabled by default.
- A cross-platform `notify` watcher records coalesced events in the v10 SQLite journal. After a short quiet period, `omera-scan` reconciles only the affected files or subtrees and the frontend refreshes from SQLite.
- Visible thumbnails have priority. Each viewport change advances a monotonic request generation, canceling stale visible and look-ahead work before decode. Near look-ahead outranks backward look-ahead, begins only after scrolling settles, and runs through serialized bounded batches.
- Gallery surfaces derive the thumbnail tier from rendered dimensions and device scale. The user's resolution preference is an upper bound, so compact cards and Table rows do not pay the decode or disk cost of the largest configured tier.
- On an exact-tier miss, the manifest supplies the smallest valid larger tier for the same source revision. Broken manifest paths are pruned during lookup before the decoder is used.
- Scanner progress crosses the Tauri boundary on a bounded cadence rather than once per file. Completion always emits immediately so the UI receives exact final counts.
- Full scans consume the directory walker as a stream and flush database upserts in bounded batches. The existing fingerprint map doubles as the unseen-file set, avoiding separate full-tree and seen-path allocations. Progress remains indeterminate during discovery and becomes exact on completion.
- Cache misses render lightweight reduced-motion-aware placeholders instead of decoding original full-resolution files inside gallery cards.
- The disk cache is populated lazily rather than generated in full during import. The v11 SQLite manifest records each file revision, size tier, codec, byte count, and rate-limited access time. A background startup worker imports legacy cache files without delaying first paint, and bounded LRU cleanup enforces the configured disk budget.
- Cache statistics, manifest synchronization, clearing, decoding, and eviction run outside the WebView thread. See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for tradeoffs and the remaining optimization plan.
- Standard library and structured-search queries return `FilePage` batches with an exact filtered total. All three gallery modes request subsequent pages near their loaded boundary and reject stale responses after context changes.
- Page filters execute against complete stored metadata, then the gallery projection removes only raw parameter/workflow fields. Prompt/model display fields and stack identity/order remain in each row, so filtering and grouping semantics are unchanged. Selection and Lightbox navigation hydrate the full record through a revision-aware bounded detail cache.
- Text-query criteria are merged with the active navigation scope before paging. Filtered stack summaries reuse the same SQLite predicate, choose a hero from matching members, and omit single-match groups; expansion requests remain inside that context. Bounded semantic results compute the equivalent summary locally in one pass.

## ⚡ Multi-Mode Folders & AIGC Ingestion Pipeline

Omera extends conventional folder management into three high-performance modes (see [INGESTION_AND_STACKING.md](INGESTION_AND_STACKING.md) for full specifications):
- **Link Folders (`link`)**: Zero-copy in-place file surveillance without file movement.
- **Managed Vaults (`managed`)**: Managed repository supporting direct drag-and-drop Copy or Move ingestion.
- **AIGC Ingestion Pipeline (`pipeline`)**: Automated surveillance of WebUI, ComfyUI, and Fooocus output directories with write-lock debouncing, atomic ingest to the library, and non-destructive delayed cleanup (grace period) moving aged source files to the OS Recycle Bin.

---

## 🗃️ Image Stacking Architecture

To solve the "AI Burst / Roll" gallery clutter problem:
- **Burst Clustering**: `omera-domain` builds a mutation-free grouping plan from normalized prompt fragments. It excludes empty prompts and existing stack members, keeps groups inside one folder/model context, and bounds comparisons by the configured generation window before the Tauri adapter persists each stack.
- **Discoverable Organization Flow**: `Tools > Organize Library by Prompt` can rescan either the current folder or every registered folder before applying the saved similarity and time-window preferences.
- **Manual Stacking**: Full keyboard-driven grouping via `Ctrl+G` (stack) and `Ctrl+Shift+G` (unstack).
- **Poker Deck Presentation**: Collapsed stack presentation with item count badges (`📚 N`), inline expansion, hero cover selection (`Alt+S`), and side-by-side comparison (`C`).
- **Filter-Aware Grouping**: Folder, album, tag, favorite, sensitivity, structured metadata, and text filters constrain both stack counts and expanded members. A stack becomes a standalone result when only one member matches.
