### Deferred: Multi-Database Support & Team Studio (MySQL & PostgreSQL)

**Correction:** The runtime is SQLite. The historical checklist below records prototype work, not working end-to-end MySQL/PostgreSQL support. Remote backends remain unavailable pending command routing, transactions, migrations and integration tests (issue #110).
*(See architectural design specification: [MULTI_DATABASE_COLLABORATION_RFC.md](./MULTI_DATABASE_COLLABORATION_RFC.md))*
- [x] Storage Engine trait abstraction with database dialect support for SQLite, MySQL 8.0+, and PostgreSQL 14+.
- [x] Keyset/cursor-based deep pagination for 500,000+ asset scale (`search_files_cursor_page`).
- [x] Cross-platform storage root mapping (`storage_roots` table and client mount configurations).
- [x] Optimistic concurrency control (`version` column) with Last-Write-Wins and set-union conflict resolution.
- [x] Tiered real-time change synchronization: default zero-DevOps change log journal polling engine (`CollaborationSyncEngine`).
- [x] Client-side on-demand local thumbnail caching preserving network storage bandwidth.
- [x] Team & Database settings panel with live latency testing and storage root mount mapping.

## 🔮 Upcoming Milestones (v0.4.0+)

### Priority: Omera identity and review fixes

Execution order and ownership: [DELIVERY_ROADMAP.md](DELIVERY_ROADMAP.md) and [ENGINEERING_HANDOFF.md](ENGINEERING_HANDOFF.md). High-impact migration, persistence and release work stays with the lead; ordinary UI, parser and bounded performance tasks are prepared for general implementation engineers.

- [ ] Complete [OMERA_MIGRATION.md](OMERA_MIGRATION.md): full identity rename, pre-1.0 legacy discovery, staged migration, and separately confirmed cleanup.
- [ ] Validate signed updates and platform installer transitions, including skipped bridge releases.
- [ ] Complete review issues #98–#117 with regression coverage.
- [ ] Measure and implement [STORAGE_EVOLUTION.md](STORAGE_EVOLUTION.md) without rewriting applied migrations.

### 🎯 Milestone 15: Video & Animation AIGC Ingestion & Playback
- [ ] **AIGC Video Metadata Extraction**: Parse embedded generation workflows and prompts from MP4 and WebM video containers (ComfyUI AnimateDiff, Wan2.1, HunyuanVideo, CogVideoX, LTX-Video, and Stable Video Diffusion).
- [ ] **Video Thumbnail Generation & Hover Scrubbing**: Extract initial frame thumbnails and implement dynamic hover scrubbing (scrub through video frames smoothly as cursor moves across card) in Grid and Waterfall gallery views.
- [ ] **Fullscreen Lightbox Video Player**: Lightbox player with seamless loop toggle, playback speed selector (0.25x - 2x), frame-by-frame stepping controls (`.` / `,`), audio toggle, and sidecar prompt/workflow inspector.
- [ ] **Video-Specific Search Facets**: Filter by duration range, resolution, frame rate (fps), container codec, and motion score.

### 🎯 Milestone 16: Next-Gen Model Architectures & Ecosystem (Flux, SD3.5 & Civitai API)
- [ ] **Flux.1 & SD3.5 Parameter Parsers**: Parse specialized generative parameters including Guidance Scale, Dual Text Encoder prompts (CLIP-L & T5-XXL), distilled sampling steps, and resolution bucket bins.
- [ ] **Civitai Direct API Integration**: Remote model reverse lookups, automatic thumbnail preview card fetching, model version update notifications, and one-click trigger word copy/injection.
- [ ] **ComfyUI Workflow Visualizer Enhancements**: Interactive workflow graph viewer highlighting prompt input nodes, KSamplers, ControlNet chains, and LoRA loaders.

### 🎯 Milestone 17: Bi-Directional ComfyUI Studio, Live Queue & Prompt Diff
- [ ] **Real-Time ComfyUI WebSocket Monitor**: Direct integration with ComfyUI `/ws` API, displaying live execution progress, queue position, active node execution, and GPU VRAM telemetry in the status bar and Activity popover.
- [ ] **Zero-Latency Ingestion Pipeline**: Stream newly generated images directly into Omera database and UI memory via IPC upon workflow completion, eliminating filesystem polling delay.
- [ ] **Prompt Diff & Matrix Workbench**: Side-by-side visual diff tool highlighting changes in positive/negative prompt syntax, weights `(keyword:1.2)`, and negative keywords across seeds, model versions, and samplers.

### 🎯 Milestone 18: Local LAN Web Companion (Omera Remote)
- [ ] **Embedded Lightweight HTTP Web Server**: Built-in Axum/Tokio web server in Tauri backend for local network access with secure PIN/passcode authentication.
- [ ] **Responsive Mobile/Tablet Web Companion**: Mobile-optimized touch UI allowing wireless browsing, rating, tagging, favoriting, and prompt copying on iPad, tablets, and smartphones on the same Wi-Fi network.
- [ ] **Live Bi-Directional State Sync**: Rating, tag, and favorite mutations applied on mobile devices immediately synchronize back to the desktop application in real time.

### 🎯 Milestone 19: Color Palette Indexing & Faceted SQL Analytics
- [ ] **Dominant Color Extraction & Palette Indexing**: Multi-threaded extraction of 5-color palettes per asset using k-means/octree quantization, indexing hex colors and lightness into `file_colors` table.
- [ ] **Color Palette Visual Filter Bar**: Interactive hue ribbon and tone picker in search drawer to filter images by dominant color family (Red, Amber, Emerald, Cyan, Violet, Monochrome, Warm, Cool).
- [ ] **Pre-Computed SQL Facet Distribution**: Migrate expensive filter aggregations (models, samplers, ratings, aspect ratio buckets) to materialized views and cached facet counters for instant multi-facet filter rendering on 100k+ item libraries.

### 🎯 Milestone 20: Library Image Compression and Conversion (planned after stabilization)

Scope, order, safety gates and handoff: [IMAGE_TRANSFORM_PLAN.md](IMAGE_TRANSFORM_PLAN.md) and [DELIVERY_ROADMAP.md](DELIVERY_ROADMAP.md), Phase 6. This is the Omera-native follow-up to [#118](https://github.com/BerryUIKI/Omera/issues/118), not a claim that its import and batch flows already exist.

- [ ] [#158](https://github.com/BerryUIKI/Omera/issues/158): Fix current export codec/extension, quality, metadata and collision/result correctness; retain directory and ZIP compatibility.
- [ ] Add export preview, size estimate and explicit per-file outcomes.
- [ ] [#159](https://github.com/BerryUIKI/Omera/issues/159): Add optional compression/conversion while importing into managed storage, retaining external originals by default.
- [ ] [#160](https://github.com/BerryUIKI/Omera/issues/160): Add verified post-import batch transformation for managed assets with keep/archive/system-Trash choices and recovery.
- [ ] Evaluate target-size, percentage resize and alignment controls after measuring quality and processing cost.
